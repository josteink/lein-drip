# lein-drip

A [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) plugin which downloads, bootstraps and installs
[drip](https://github.com/flatland/drip) as the default JVM to use for faster
[Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) startup.

## Clojure-external dependencies

Drip depends on gcc and other tools for self-bootstrapping, so you probably
want to ensure you have the normal build-tools installed. On Debian-based
distros you do it like this:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential

## Usage

**Note:** Plugin is only designed to work on Unix-based system. With drip not
having a Windows-version, the plugin is not designed with Windows-portability
in mind.

Put `[lein-drip "0.1.1-SNAPSHOT"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`~/.lein/profiles.clj`. Leiningen 2.x is assumed:

A minimal config should look like this:

    { :user { :plugins [[lein-drip "0.1.1-SNAPSHOT"]]}}

After that execute the following code once, while in a project folder:

    $ lein drip

If something goes wrong and you want to force the process to be run again, you can apply the `force` parameter.
This will also upgrade drip if a new version is avaiable.

    $ lein drip force

To upgrade drip to latest version, you can also use the following option:

    $ lein drip upgrade

## Compatibility

Lein-drip has been tested with Leiningen 2.0.0 and drip 0.2.2.
